MyContact
===

MyContact is a Zend Framework 2 module based on [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](https://github.com/weierophinney)'s [PhlyContact](https://github.com/weierophinney/PhlyContact).

DISCLAIMER: This is pretty much my first ZF2 module so it probably has a lot of rough edges. I didn't fork the original project because I didn't really knew where to go from there, I just needed to mock about with a simple module.
